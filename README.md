# Picture Yo-self
Fun Photobooth for Rice students!

### Brainstorm

We are planning on prototyping a photo booth using Raspberry Pi. We will design a user interface on a touchscreen so that users can select filters and backgrounds for their pictures and then draw or write messages on them. Users will then have the option to either print their pictures or have them sent via email. As an added challenge, we would like to play around with OpenCV to see if we can implement fun special effects like making the userâ€™s eyes or mouth larger than normal in photos. We will likely use Python to write most of our programming.



### Abstract

Team Picture Yourself will create a photobooth that will allow users to choose various frames and filters and draw or write messages on their images as desired. The need for such a device arises from the dearth of quality photobooths in Houston in general and also at specific events such as Esperanza and Rondelet, two major prom-esque parties that occur annually at Rice. We will be designing and prototyping the hardware necessary for a working photobooth. We will be using Raspberry Pi, the Pi camera, a 7-inch capacitive touchscreen, and potentially other accessories to recreate and surpass the capabilities of photobooths that are currently available and tailor them specifically to Rice students. 

Our strategy is to begin by building a basic photobooth device, where a user is able to take a picture, check the quality of the photo, and email it to themselves. From there, we will be incorporating additional functionality including, but not limited to:

- filters
- picture frames
- drawing or writing messages on the photo
- incorporating automatic feature detection with OpenCV so users can distort or embellish facial features

### Update 12/1/2015

We have completed prototyping our final project, and have incorporated many of the functions we hoped to have including:

- drawing and writing messages on photo
- retake button
- clear screen button to clear drawings/writings
- crest of your college automatically embedded into photo -> by typing in your netID, the program will automatically find your college and put your college crest onto the picture
- emailing picture to your Rice email with your name in the subject line

Some ideas for future iterations of our device include:
- filters
- picture frames
- automatic feature detection with OpenCV so users can distort or embellish facial features
- allow users to choose color that they are writing with with colorwheel
